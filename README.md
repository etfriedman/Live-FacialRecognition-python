# Face Recognition in python using a pre trained DNN (Deep Nueral Network)

Make sure you have:
os
numpy
face_recognition (get it here: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)

Inside the folder "Faces" put a .jpg or .jpeg image of someones face, just one face per image. When you run the notebook it will train the face and be able to detect it. a python window will pop up showing your webcam.

press q to stop the webcam.
