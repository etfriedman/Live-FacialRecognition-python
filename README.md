# Face Recognition in python using a pre trained DNN (Deep Nueral Network)

## Use of face_recognition library, edited to train on any number of images that you put inside the /Faces/ Folder.

**Make sure you have:
-os
-numpy
-dlib (some tutorials on how to get it online, look it up)
-face_recognition (get it here: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)
-opencv **

most of these come with anaconda, except opencv, dlib.

Inside the folder "Faces" put a .jpg or .jpeg image of someones face, just one face per image. When you run the notebook it will train the face and be able to detect it. a python window will pop up showing your webcam.

press q to stop the webcam.
